I am currently a graduate student at UIUC. I am part of the [i-acoma research group](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/) advised by [Professor Josep Torrellas](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html). These days I mostly find myself messing with the [linux hypervisor](http://www.linux-kvm.org/) and studying VM performance and operational characteristics.
